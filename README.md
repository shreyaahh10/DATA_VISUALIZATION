This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a healthcare stroke dataset using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The dataset is cleaned by handling missing BMI values using median imputation, and key demographic and health-related features such as age, smoking status, work type, BMI, and average glucose level are analyzed. Various visualizations including bar charts, histograms, pie charts, box plots, and Seaborn plots (pair plot, violin plot, scatter plot, and count plot) are used to identify distributions, trends, and relationships that may be associated with stroke risk. This project is intended for learning and demonstrates basic data preprocessing and visualization techniques relevant to data analytics and healthcare analysis.
